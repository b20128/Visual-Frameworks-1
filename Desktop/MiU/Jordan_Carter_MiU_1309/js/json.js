I never left my body though i felt, if i gave the command to my body to jump, i wouldnt be here right now like if i wanted to go i could have. i seen what had to have been 2 angels, i remember one of them asking the other 'this one?', and the other saying to the first, 'not yet.' telling another it wasnt my time yet, a light brighter than any i had ever seen behind them then, nothing."]
